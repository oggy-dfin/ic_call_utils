## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

* Updated the Rust CDK dependency. This will now cause a clash with 0.17 and earlier versions of the CDK if used in the same workspace, avoiding issues from mixing and matching the two in production.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-09

- Fix the naming and docs in ic-safe-upgrades
